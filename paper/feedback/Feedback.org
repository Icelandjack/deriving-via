The kinds V, D and C must unify

I think I get it now"

This is a great improvement on the first draft. Some notes:

- The focus on QuickCheck in the chapter 2 title is distracting. I’d
  move section 1.2 into chapter 2 and rename that whole section
  ”Introducing DerivingVia” (you can retain the QuickCheck example,
  but remember the primary purpose of chapter 2 is to explain
  DerivingVia informally).

- I’d rename chapter 3 to ”Implementation” or something, as it’s not
  just about typechecking.

Content-wise I’m missing a formal specification of desugaring DV into
coerce/type applications (e.g. a nice square with rewrite rules). This
would make the paper more readable for the more theoretical readers
and be more informative than any number of examples.

on first glance I would make a bigger deal out of this work enabling
derived typeclasses to be "modular"

I'll send over an annotated pdf when I'm done
