A GHC Proposal is a document describing a proposed change to the
compiler, the GHC/Haskell language, or the libraries in the GHC.*
module namespace. These include,

    A syntactic change to GHC/Haskell (e.g. the various ShortImports
    proposals, do expressions without $) A major change to the
    user-visible behaviour of the compiler (e.g. the recent change in
    super-class solving, and -Wall behavior) The addition of major
    features to the compiler (e.g. -XTypeInType, GHCi commands,
    type-indexed Typeable representations)

Changes to the GHC API or the plugin API are not automatically within the scope of the committee, and can be contributed following
