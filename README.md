# deriving-via

I will add "quick thoughts" to this gist https://gist.github.com/Icelandjack/1bc5039180b3c8707983b1682e7245fd because I can more easily add them as comments.

# For Presentation

* Meaning is not tied to representation, but tied to types / names
* Mention different representations, in terms of deriving via newtypes (`GHC.Generics` is a must) but also `Pair a` <-> `Bool -> a` <-> `(a, a)`
